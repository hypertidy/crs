Description: Obtain coordinate system metadata from various data formats. There 
 are functions to extract a 'CRS' (coordinate reference system, 
 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>) in 'EPSG' (European 
 Petroleum Survey Group, <http://epsg.org/>), 'PROJ4' <https://proj.org/>, 
 or 'WKT2' (Well-Known Text 2, 
 <http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html>) forms. This is 
 purely for getting simple metadata from in-memory formats, please use other 
 tools for out of memory data sources.
